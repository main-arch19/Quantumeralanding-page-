/**
 * Fires the conversion pair once per lead.
 *
 * Both events land here rather than at submit time because the server action
 * redirects — there is no client-side "success" moment to hook. Reaching this
 * page with a lead id means a submission genuinely passed server validation,
 * which is a stricter definition of a conversion than "clicked submit."
 *
 * Deduped on the lead id so a refresh or a back-forward cache restore cannot
 * double-count. transaction_id gives Google Ads the same guarantee server-side.
 *
 * `variant` separates the two populations that land here. A discount claim
 * comes from the exit offer — caught on the way out rather than volunteered,
 * which makes it the weaker signal even though both forms ask for the same
 * three things. Reporting that cannot tell them apart overstates both. It
 * rides on the GA4 event only; the Ads conversion fires
 * for both, so the platform still optimises on every submission. If claim
 * quality turns out poor, skipping trackAdsConversion for "discount" is the
 * single line to change.
