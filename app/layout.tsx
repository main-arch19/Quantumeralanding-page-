 * to Google, no render-blocking stylesheet, and no layout shift.
 *
 * Two families, not three: Lato sets both the display type and the body copy,
 * so the page speaks in one voice. IBM Plex Mono stays because Lato has no
 * monospace sibling and the timestamp eyebrows and notification cards need
 * tabular figures — that is what makes the time motif read as a system.
 *
 * Lato ships no 500 on Google Fonts (100/300/400/700/900), which is why body
 * text that wants emphasis uses font-bold rather than font-medium.
